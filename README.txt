Lab07 Report

Note: I could not get long press to work but I left my code in the file commented out,  PLEASE USE BUTTON 2
IN ORDER TO SWITCH FROM TEMPERATURE TO TIME IN ORDER TO DEBUG THAT AS I WAS UNABLE TO GET LONG PRESS TO WORK.

Summary:  
The lab was quite simple except for the long press.  I understood state machines quite well and was able to grasp
the printing after a while.  The only thing I struggled with was the long press, which after about 3 hours of
attempting to get to work, decided it wasn't worth it and I could afford to lose a few points for my sanity.

Approach:
The approach offered by the lab manual was especially helpful as it gave me guidance as how to start the lab
and helped me break up the bigger problem into smaller more manageable problems to work on.  What really helped
was the diagram which was very very helpful and probably made it possible for me to finish the lab in time (even
though it doesn't work).  As I worked through the lab, I struggled at a few points, including the buttons and the
adc but after getting those working, I was able to finish most of the rest of the lab with quite ease. I didn't
work with other students during the lab sessions as I am a lone ranger and like to feel the accomplishment
of finishing the lab by myself with exception of the TA's.

Implementation:
I probably spent the most time on this lab, around 15 hours as it took me quite a while to understand the flow
of state machines.  I liked that this lab was very rewarding to understand and I quite enjoyed seeing results
on the pic32 as I worked.  I would more explicitly define the long press buttons part as I was unable to get it
in the end.  The points seem appropriate, I would probably allocate more to extra functions which you should
push the students to write as I believe it makes the problem much more manageable.  The manual covered everything
pretty well except for the long press.  In class discussion was definitely helpful and helped me understand
the structure of the lab much better than I would have if I hadn't payed attention.

Thanks TA's again! =)
